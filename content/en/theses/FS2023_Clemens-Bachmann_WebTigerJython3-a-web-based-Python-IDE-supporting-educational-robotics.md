In this thesis, we lay the groundwork for WebTigerJython 3, which is a rewrite of the WebTigerJython IDE. As in its predecessors, Python syntax has been extended with elements such as the repeat loop. Python can be executed directly in the browser without the need of a backend server.

The focus of this thesis was making the IDE usable for programming robotics. We began by providing support for programming the micro:bit, with plans to eventually support additional robots in the future. The IDE offers the ability to export code for the micro:bit and flash the robot directly from the browser. We have also included libraries for programming micro:bit extension boards, such as the Maqueen robot and an LED ring.

Additionally, we have included a reference containing a collection of frequently used commands, along with code snippets that can be easily inserted into the code editor using drag and drop.

The textbook “Einfach Informatik: Programmieren 7--9” teaches students core concepts of programming, and with this algorithmic thinking, using TigerJython, a Python dialect and programming environment. WebTigerJython is a web-based programming environment closely mimicking TigerJython, which can be used together with the textbook “Einfach Informatik: Programmieren 7-9”. In this thesis, we extend WebTigerJython with a database library implementing all the methods introduced in the database chapter of the textbook and providing easy-to-understand error messaging. With our implementation, students will be able to solve the related exercises in the textbook using the WebTigerJython platform. We also conducted an evaluation lecture teaching the core functionalities of the database library to a small class and collected feedback. Taking this feedback into consideration, we enriched the library with new methods and functionality such as importing and exporting database tables in form of CSV files.

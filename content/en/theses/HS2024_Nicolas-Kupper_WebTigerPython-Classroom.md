This thesis presents Classroom, a modern learning platform that meets modern security standards and allows teachers and students to use state of the art technologies to teach and learn. The Center for Computer Science Education of the ETH Zurich (ABZ) developed numerous teaching materials for a wide range of student profiles as well as programming environments, one of which is WebTigerPython. WebTigerPython is a programming environment which supports Turtle Graphics and various hardware devices in order to teach programming. In a previous work, a small frontend-only prototype was built which combines the integration of WebTigerPython with the ability to write numerous types of exercises, such as multiple choice questions using Markdown. In this thesis, the new productive learning platform Classroom was developed from scratch and deployed at \href{https://classroom.ethz.ch}{https://classroom.ethz.ch}. Classroom fully integrates WebTigerPython which avoids the necessity of using external programming platforms when creating or solving coding exercises. This allows for a seamless integration of the learning platform and the programming environment for a better user experience. Classroom extends the rich text editor Quill, allowing teachers to easily create various types of exercises, including coding exercises. By combining multiple frameworks, such as the Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) framework Yjs, the rich text editor used in Classroom has been made collaborative. This allows teachers to easily work on content simultaneously which enhances collaborative team work.

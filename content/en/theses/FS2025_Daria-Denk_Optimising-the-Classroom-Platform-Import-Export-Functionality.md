This thesis extends the Classroom learning platform by implementing an import/export functionality for course content. Motivation is the need for teachers to retain control over their material. The solution supports published and unpublished content, maintains formatting and exercises, and ensures consistency using a single backend transaction. Extensive testing including edge cases, malicious inputs as well as a teacher test were performed to validate functionality.

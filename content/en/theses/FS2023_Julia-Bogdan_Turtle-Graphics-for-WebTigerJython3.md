This bachelor thesis presents the development and integration of Turtle Graphics into WebTigerJython-3, an interactive web-based educational platform aimed at introducing beginners to programming and computational thinking.

Turtle Graphics is a widespread visual programming concept made popular by Seymour Papert in the 1960s. It revolutionized the way beginners learn how to write code by allowing them to create intricate drawings and designs using a simple set of commands.

Integrating this feature into WebTigerJython-3 aims to enhance the learning experience by fostering creativity, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills among learners.
The thesis outlines the design and implementation of the Turtle Graphics module with a focus on implementation and design to support the further development of the project.

Has your school acquired **micro:bits**, but you‚Äôre not sure how to use them effectively in class?  
Are you teaching a class without prior programming experience and looking for an engaging introduction?  
Or do you simply want to try out new, tested teaching materials for computer science?

**Join our robotics research project!** üöÄ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please note:** This project is currently only available for German-speaking schools. All teaching materials and activities are in German.

We offer an **8-week teaching sequence** that introduces your students to **Python programming**. You will receive **teaching materials** and our support to implement the project successfully.

There are **two exciting learning paths** to choose from:

{{< track-cards >}}

{{< track-card img="/images/robots/maqueen_plusV3.png" title="Track 1: Mobile Robot" track="robot">}}
Programming a mobile robot: avoid obstacles and perform driving maneuvers.

{{< track-card img="/images/robots/LED-ring.png" title="Track 2: LED Ring" track="led">}}
Programming a 24-light LED ring: colorful light patterns, animations, and music.

We want to find out which approach works best in the classroom. Which students prefer which track? What learning progress is achieved? These are questions where **you can help us**!

**Your contribution**:

‚úî Teach one of the sequences in your class using our materials.

‚úî Have your class complete an **online questionnaire** before and after the teaching sequence.

‚úî Provide us with brief **feedback** on your experience with the materials.

{{< section title="What is this about?" open=true >}}

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please note:** This project is currently only available for German-speaking schools. All teaching materials and activities are in German.

Do you want to introduce your **7th and 8th grade students** to **Python programming** in a playful way?  
In our project, you will receive ready-made teaching materials and support to try out two exciting approaches:

* Track 1: Programming a **mobile robot**
* Track 2: Controlling a **24-LED ring**

Together, we aim to find out which approach best fosters students‚Äô interest and understanding. Your experience and feedback help us develop the best teaching methods ‚Äì and you benefit from tested, practical materials for your class.

{{< section title="Who can participate?" >}}

This project is aimed at **computer science and robotics teachers** at secondary schools teaching **7th or 8th grade classes without programming experience**.

{{< /section >}}

{{< section title="Duration and Process" >}}

The project consists of **10 double lessons**, structured as follows:

* **8 double lessons**: teaching based on our materials.
* **2 double lessons**: tests and questionnaires for evaluation.

The process can be summarized as:

1. **Preparation**: You receive all teaching materials. On request, we offer an introduction to the WebTigerPython programming environment.
2. **Introduction for students**: A research team member visits your school, presents the project, and distributes **consent forms** to parents/guardians. Duration: approx. **15 minutes**.
3. **Pre-tests**: Students complete computer-based questionnaires about their **prior knowledge in robotics and programming** and their **attitudes toward computer science**. Duration: approx. **1 double lesson**.
4. **Teaching**: You teach your class **8 double lessons** using our materials.
5. **Post-tests**: Students complete questionnaires again to assess **learning progress** and **changes in attitudes**. Duration: approx. **1 double lesson**.
6. **Feedback**: You share your **experience** with the materials and project. Feedback can be given anytime during or after the sequence.

**Note**: You can independently design and conduct your own **tests** regardless of the research team.

{{< /section >}}

{{< section title="What is your role?" >}}
* **Organization**: Collect the **consent forms** and forward them to our research team.
* **Teaching**: Teach **8 double lessons** based on our materials.
* **Online Questionnaires**: Students complete online questionnaires at the beginning and end of the project.
* **Your feedback matters!** Share your experiences with us.

We support you throughout the project and are available for any questions.

This section lists the learning objectives for each track and week.

{{< collapse title="Track 1: Mobile Robot" track="robot">}}

* Students evaluate logical statements (e.g., `getDistance() < 50`) and predict when they are true or false.
* Students explain how the infrared sensor works.
* Students experiment to find out what values the infrared sensor returns on different surfaces.
  {{< /subcollapse >}}

{{< subcollapse "Week 4 ‚Äì Providing Alternatives and Following Lines" >}}
* Students explain why an `else`-block is necessary for alternative actions when a condition is not met.

  {{< /subcollapse >}}

{{< subcollapse "Week 5 ‚Äì Storing Values with Variables" >}}
* Students explain why variables are needed to reuse sensor values.
* Students identify errors caused by missing variables, e.g., duplicate calls to `random.randint`.

* Students perform calculations using sensor data.
  {{< /subcollapse >}}

{{< subcollapse "Week 6 ‚Äì Counting with Variables" >}}
* Students use variables to track whether the robot has crossed a black stripe.
* Students recognize that counting stripes without variables is inefficient or impossible.
* Students purposefully use variables as counters (e.g., crossed stripes, rotations in a direction).

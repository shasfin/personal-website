Hello, I'm Alexandra Maximova. I joined the [Algorithms and Didactics](https://algodi.ethz.ch/en/) group in 2022 and since then I focus on programming education and robotics. My research explores how lower secondary school students learn to code and how different teaching methods influence their understanding and motivation. If you are a teacher and would like to get involved in this project, feel free to contact me or read up all the details [here](for-teachers/get-involved/).

I’m particularly interested in making programming more accessible and engaging for beginners. As part of this mission, my colleague Clemens Bachmann and I have worked on developing [WebTigerPython](https://webtigerpython.ethz.ch), a programming environment for novice Python programmers, featuring turtle graphics, coordinate graphics, robotics, and in-browser Python execution. Try it out in your classroom, or take a peek at the list of [supervised theses](theses) or directly at the [documentation](https://docs.webtigerpython.ethz.ch/) to see which features are already available or will be added soon.

Before joining the Algorithms and Didactics group, I worked as a software engineer. Over time, my passion for education led me to start a teaching diploma and teach programming courses for the talented and gifted at [ABZ](https://abz.inf.ethz.ch/). Today, however, my focus is on opening up programming to all learners—regardless of prior knowledge or special talents. I truly enjoy exploring new ways to spark curiosity in young learners and help them develop confidence in coding—whether through research, teaching, or building tools that make learning more intuitive and fun.
